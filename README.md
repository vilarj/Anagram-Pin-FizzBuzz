# Lab 1: Anagram
Your task is to write a simple anagram detector: it compares two phrases and reports whether or not they use the same number of the same letters (ignoring case and any non-letter symbols). The detector will work by checking if both phrases use the same number of each letter: 1. The countLetters method counts how many times each letter occurs in a word and returns an array of integers representing this tally. The 0th element represents how many a or A’s were found in the word, the 1st element represents how many b/B’s, … and the 25th element how many z/Z’s. All other symbols are ignored in the resulting array. 2. The sameCounts method compares two integer arrays and returns true only if they have the same contents, including their sizes and values for each element. Note: you are not allowed to use Arrays.equals, or equivalent, to implement this method.

# Lab 2: Pin
Your tasks is to write a pin program that converts ints into letters

# Lab 3: Fizzbuzz
The “Fizz Buzz Problem” is a well-known interview question. It usually is given as something like the
following:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print
“Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers that
are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
In this assignment, you’ll be implementing a variation of this problem to make sure you are comfortable
writing a simple Java program from scratch using command line arguments.
